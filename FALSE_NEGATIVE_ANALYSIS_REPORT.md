# False Negative Analysis & Improvement Recommendations
## Entity Name Resolution System (OPENAI-LARGE + ADAPTIVE Configuration)

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-24
**Dataset:** 739 company names, 229 ground truth groups
**Configuration:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-large + Adaptive GMM Thresholding

---

## Executive Summary

The best-performing configuration (OPENAI-LARGE + ADAPTIVE) achieved:
- **F1 Score:** 82.4%
- **Precision:** 93.0% (excellent - low false positives)
- **Recall:** 74.0% (needs improvement - missing 26% of matches)
- **False Negatives:** 399 pairs (out of 1,421 ground truth pairs)

### Key Finding
**48.4% of false negatives fall into the "OTHER" category**, indicating the system is missing matches that don't fit obvious patterns. Most missed pairs have surprisingly high component scores:
- **Mean Confidence:** 68.7% (very close to threshold!)
- **Mean WRatio:** 76.1/100
- **Mean Token Set:** 63.8/100
- **Mean Embedding:** 71.7/100

**Critical Insight:** 37.6% of false negatives have confidence scores **above 80%**, yet were rejected by the adaptive threshold (T_HIGH=58.2%). This suggests the GMM-based threshold is too conservative.

## Detailed False Negative Analysis

### 1. Category Distribution

| Category | Count | Percentage | Description |
|----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **OTHER** | 193 | 48.4% | No obvious pattern; high scores but below threshold |
| **ABBREVIATION** | 144 | 36.1% | Severe length mismatch (e.g., "IBM" vs "International Business Machines") |
| **NICKNAME** | 44 | 11.0% | Informal/shortened names (e.g., "AmEx" vs "American Express") |
| **TRANSLITERATION** | 40 | 10.0% | Non-ASCII characters (e.g., "Nestlé" vs "Nestle") |
| **PARTIAL_NAME** | 25 | 6.3% | One name is subset of another |
| **LOW_SEMANTIC** | 10 | 2.5% | Embeddings failed to capture similarity |
| **WORD_ORDER** | 5 | 1.3% | Different word arrangement |
| **TYPO** | 3 | 0.8% | Misspellings with high WRatio |

**Note:** Categories overlap; a pair can have multiple tags.

### 2. Confidence Score Distribution

| Range | Count | Percentage | Observation |
|-------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 0-20% | 0 | 0.0% | No extreme mismatches |
| 20-40% | 9 | 2.3% | Clear rejections |
| 40-60% | 78 | 19.5% | Borderline cases |
| 60-80% | 156 | 39.1% | **Should be matched!** |
| **80-100%** | **150** | **37.6%** | **Critical: High confidence but rejected** |

**Problem:** 150 pairs (37.6%) scored 80-100% confidence but were not grouped. This is a **severe threshold calibration issue**.

### 3. Component Score Analysis

| Component | Mean | Min | Max | Weight |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|--------|
| WRatio (fuzzy) | 76.1 | 20.0 | 100.0 | 40% |
| Token Set | 63.8 | 10.5 | 100.0 | 15% |
| Embedding | 71.7 | 27.0 | 100.0 | 45% |

**Observation:** All three components have reasonably high mean scores (>60), suggesting:
1. The individual matchers are working well
2. The **threshold is the primary bottleneck**, not the scoring functions

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why is the system missing 399 pairs?

#### 1. **Adaptive GMM Threshold Too Conservative (PRIMARY CAUSE)**
- **Current:** T_HIGH = 58.2% (auto-accept threshold)
- **Problem:** 37.6% of false negatives score **above 80%**
- **Impact:** The GMM is overfitting to the "different companies" cluster, making the acceptance threshold too strict

**Evidence:**
```
Adaptive thresholds: T_LOW=0.447, S_90=0.555, T_HIGH=0.582
GMM cluster means: 0.275 (different), 0.878 (same)
```

The T_HIGH threshold (58.2%) is far below the "same company" cluster mean (87.8%), leaving many valid matches in a gray zone.

#### 2. **Abbreviation/Acronym Detection Inadequate (36.1% of FNs)**
- Current approach: Phonetic matching, embedding similarity
- **Gap:** Names like "GM" vs "General Motors" or "IBM" vs "International Business Machines" have:
  - Low WRatio (short vs long string)
  - Moderate token_set (few shared tokens)
  - Variable embedding similarity (context-dependent)

**Example False Negatives:**
- "JPM" ↔ "JPMorgan Chase"
- "MSFT" ↔ "Microsoft Corporation"
- "BAC" ↔ "Bank of America"

#### 3. **"OTHER" Category Represents Near-Misses (48.4% of FNs)**
- These are pairs that score 50-80% confidence
- They fall in the promotion zone (S_90=55.5% to T_HIGH=58.2%)
- **Adaptive mode requires phonetic agreement** to promote them
- Many don't get phonetic bonus due to:
  - Different word counts
  - Acronyms/abbreviations (phonetics skipped)
  - Token-by-token mismatch despite overall similarity

## Improvement Recommendations

### **Recommendation #1: Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**
**Priority:** HIGH
**Complexity:** LOW
**Estimated Impact:** +8-12% recall, minimal precision loss

#### What Problem It Solves
Fixes the primary issue: **T_HIGH is too conservative**, rejecting 150 high-confidence pairs (80-100% scores).

#### How It Would Work Technically

**Option A: Raise GMM Posterior Probability Target (Recommended)**
```python
# Current: T_HIGH is where P(same|score) = 0.98
# Proposed: T_HIGH is where P(same|score) = 0.90

# In gmm_threshold_service.py
self.t_high_threshold = self.find_threshold_for_posterior(0.90)  # Was 0.98
self.s_90_threshold = self.find_threshold_for_posterior(0.75)     # Was 0.90
```

**Rationale:**
- P(same|score) = 0.98 is extremely conservative (98% certainty)
- Lowering to 0.90 (90% certainty) better balances precision/recall
- Still maintains high precision (90% confidence is strong)

**Option B: Add Post-GMM Confidence Boost**
```python
# After GMM thresholds calculated, apply boost to borderline pairs
def adjust_threshold_for_borderline(self, score, phonetic_agree):
    if self.s_90_threshold <= score < self.t_high_threshold:
        if phonetic_agree:
            return min(self.t_high_threshold + 0.05, score + 0.10)  # Boost by 10%
    return score
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Modify `gmm_threshold_service.py::calculate_adaptive_thresholds()`
2. Change P(same|score) targets from 0.98/0.90/0.02 to 0.90/0.75/0.05
3. Test on validation set
4. Tune targets based on F1 score optimization

**Expected Results:**
- **Recall:** 74% → 82-86% (+8-12%)
- **Precision:** 93% → 89-91% (-2-4%)
- **F1 Score:** 82.4% → 85-88% (+3-6%)

**Why This Works:**
- The 150 pairs scoring 80-100% are almost certainly true matches
- Current threshold rejects them despite high confidence
- Small threshold adjustment captures these near-misses
- Minimal precision loss because we're only accepting high-confidence pairs

---

### **Recommendation #2: Acronym/Abbreviation Augmentation**
**Priority:** HIGH
**Complexity:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Impact:** +5-8% recall, no precision loss

#### What Problem It Solves
Addresses **36.1% of false negatives** (abbreviation category): matches like "IBM" ↔ "International Business Machines" that have severe length mismatch.

#### How It Would Work Technically

**Approach: Fuzzy Acronym Matching**

Add a new component to confidence scoring that detects abbreviation relationships:

```python
def calculate_abbreviation_score(self, short_name: str, long_name: str) -> float:
    """
    Detect if short_name is an abbreviation/acronym of long_name.

    Returns 0.0-1.0 score indicating likelihood of abbreviation relationship.
    """
    # 1. Extract initials from long name
    long_words = long_name.split()
    initials = ''.join([w[0] for w in long_words if w])

    # 2. Check exact acronym match
    if short_name.lower() == initials.lower():
        return 1.0

    # 3. Check fuzzy acronym match (allow skipped words)
    if len(short_name) <= 5 and short_name.isupper():
        # Try all subsequences of initials
        from itertools import combinations
        for combo in combinations(range(len(long_words)), len(short_name)):
            candidate = ''.join([long_words[i][0] for i in combo])
            if short_name.lower() == candidate.lower():
                return 0.9

    # 4. Check partial containment (e.g., "AmEx" in "American Express")
    if short_name.lower() in long_name.lower():
        # Weight by length ratio
        ratio = len(short_name) / len(long_name)
        return min(0.8, ratio * 2)

    # 5. Check syllable abbreviation (e.g., "FedEx" = "Federal Express")
    syllables_match = self._check_syllable_abbreviation(short_name, long_name)
    if syllables_match:
        return 0.85

    return 0.0

def _check_syllable_abbreviation(self, short: str, long: str) -> bool:
    """Check if short name is syllable-based abbreviation of long name."""
    long_words = long.split()
    if len(long_words) < 2:
        return False

    # Extract first few characters from each word
    syllables = ''.join([w[:2] for w in long_words[:3]])  # "Federal Express" -> "feex"
    return short.lower()[:4] == syllables.lower()[:4]
```

**Integration into confidence scoring:**

```python
def calculate_confidence(self, name1: str, name2: str) -> float:
    # ... existing code ...

    # NEW: Check for abbreviation relationship
    len1, len2 = len(norm1), len(norm2)
    abbrev_score = 0.0

    if len1 < len2 * 0.5:  # name1 might be abbreviation
        abbrev_score = self.calculate_abbreviation_score(norm1, norm2)
    elif len2 < len1 * 0.5:  # name2 might be abbreviation
        abbrev_score = self.calculate_abbreviation_score(norm2, norm1)

    # If strong abbreviation signal, boost embedding component
    if abbrev_score > 0.7:
        # Treat as strong match, boost final score
        base_score = base_score + (abbrev_score * 15)  # +15 point boost

    # ... rest of scoring ...
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `calculate_abbreviation_score()` to `NameMatcher` class
2. Integrate into `calculate_confidence()` method
3. Add configuration parameter: `ABBREVIATION_BOOST_WEIGHT = 15.0`
4. Test on known acronyms (IBM, GE, GM, etc.)
5. Tune boost weight based on validation performance

**Expected Results:**
- **Recall:** 74% → 79-82% (+5-8%)
- **Precision:** 93% → 93-94% (slight improvement!)
- **F1 Score:** 82.4% → 85-87% (+3-5%)

**Why This Works:**
- Directly addresses the "short vs long" problem
- Acronym detection is high-precision (few false positives)
- Boosts confidence for obvious abbreviations (IBM, MSFT, etc.)
- Complements embeddings (which struggle with abbreviations)

---

### **Recommendation #3: Hybrid Threshold Strategy (Fixed + Adaptive)**
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Complexity:** LOW
**Estimated Impact:** +3-5% recall, maintains precision

#### What Problem It Solves
Addresses the **"OTHER" category** (48.4% of FNs): pairs that score well but fall in the gray zone between S_90 and T_HIGH.

#### How It Would Work Technically

**Approach: Dual-Pass Matching**

Combine fixed threshold (for high-confidence matches) with adaptive GMM (for borderline cases):

```python
def group_similar_names_hybrid(self, names: List[str]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
    """
    Hybrid grouping strategy:
    1. First pass: Fixed threshold (85%) for high-confidence matches
    2. Second pass: GMM adaptive for remaining borderline cases
    """
    groups = []
    ungrouped = set(names)

    # PASS 1: Fixed threshold (high confidence)
    FIXED_THRESHOLD = 0.85
    for i, name1 in enumerate(names):
        if name1 not in ungrouped:
            continue

        group = [name1]
        ungrouped.remove(name1)

        for name2 in ungrouped.copy():
            confidence = self.calculate_confidence(name1, name2)
            if confidence >= FIXED_THRESHOLD:
                group.append(name2)
                ungrouped.remove(name2)

        if len(group) > 1:
            groups.append(group)

    # PASS 2: GMM adaptive for borderline (55-85% range)
    if self.use_adaptive_threshold and len(ungrouped) > 0:
        borderline_names = list(ungrouped)

        # Calculate GMM thresholds for remaining pairs
        gmm_groups = self._group_with_gmm_adaptive(borderline_names)
        groups.extend(gmm_groups)

    # Remaining ungrouped = singletons
    for name in ungrouped:
        groups.append([name])

    return groups
```

**Alternative: Confidence Band Adjustment**

```python
def adjust_confidence_for_hybrid(self, base_confidence: float,
                                  gmm_t_high: float) -> float:
    """
    Apply different acceptance rules based on confidence band:
    - [85-100%]: Auto-accept (fixed threshold)
    - [T_HIGH-85%]: GMM promotion zone (phonetic required)
    - [S_90-T_HIGH]: GMM with reduced penalty
    - [0-S_90%]: Reject
    """
    if base_confidence >= 0.85:
        return base_confidence  # Auto-accept (fixed threshold)
    elif base_confidence >= gmm_t_high:
        return base_confidence  # GMM auto-accept zone
    elif base_confidence >= self.s_90_threshold:
        # Promotion zone: reduce margin penalty
        penalty = self._calculate_margin_penalty(base_confidence)
        return base_confidence + 4 - (penalty * 0.5)  # Half penalty
    else:
        return base_confidence  # Reject
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `group_similar_names_hybrid()` method to `NameMatcher`
2. Add configuration flag: `USE_HYBRID_THRESHOLD = True`
3. Modify main processing logic to call hybrid method
4. Test on validation set
5. Compare single-pass vs dual-pass performance

**Expected Results:**
- **Recall:** 74% → 77-79% (+3-5%)
- **Precision:** 93% → 91-92% (-1-2%)
- **F1 Score:** 82.4% → 83-85% (+1-3%)

**Why This Works:**
- High-confidence matches (85%+) avoid GMM conservatism
- Borderline cases (55-85%) benefit from GMM's data-driven approach
- Reduces dependency on a single threshold
- Provides fallback if GMM is too conservative

**Trade-offs:**
- Two-pass processing adds ~10-20% overhead
- More complex logic (harder to tune)
- Potential for inconsistency between passes

## Comparison of Recommendations

| Recommendation | Complexity | Est. Recall Gain | Est. Precision Change | Implementation Time | Risk |
|----------------|------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------|
| **#1: Dynamic Threshold Adjustment** | LOW | +8-12% | -2-4% | 2-4 hours | LOW |
| **#2: Acronym Augmentation** | MEDIUM | +5-8% | 0% to +1% | 1-2 days | LOW |
| **#3: Hybrid Threshold Strategy** | LOW | +3-5% | -1-2% | 4-8 hours | MEDIUM |

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Start with Recommendation #1** (Dynamic Threshold Adjustment)
   - Fastest to implement
   - Highest impact on recall
   - Directly addresses the primary bottleneck
   - Easy to tune and rollback

2. **Then add Recommendation #2** (Acronym Augmentation)
   - Complementary to threshold adjustment
   - Targets a specific, well-defined problem (36% of FNs)
   - Likely to improve precision as well
   - Provides interpretable boost

3. **Consider Recommendation #3** (Hybrid Strategy) as fallback
   - Only if #1 and #2 don't achieve target recall
   - More complex, harder to tune
   - Useful for fine-tuning after initial improvements

### Expected Combined Impact

If implementing **Recommendation #1 + #2**:
- **Recall:** 74% → 84-90% (+10-16%)
- **Precision:** 93% → 89-91% (-2-4%)
- **F1 Score:** 82.4% → 86-90% (+4-8%)

This would bring the system close to **90% F1 score**, which is excellent for entity resolution.

## Additional Observations

### 1. **Embedding Quality is Strong**
- Mean embedding score: 71.7/100 for false negatives
- Embeddings are doing their job; threshold is the issue
- No need to switch to a different embedding model

### 2. **Phonetic Matching is Underutilized**
- Only provides ±2-4% adjustment
- Could be more aggressive in promotion zone
- Consider +6-8% boost for phonetic agreement

### 3. **Token Set Weight May Be Too Low**
- Current: 15% (reduced from 40% to fix shared-word problem)
- For abbreviations, token set is more helpful than embeddings
- Consider adaptive weighting based on name characteristics

### 4. **Transliteration Issues are Minor**
- Only 10% of FNs involve non-ASCII characters
- Current `unidecode` approach is working
- No immediate action needed

---

## Testing Plan

To validate these recommendations:

1. **Create validation split**
   - Hold out 20% of ground truth pairs
   - Ensure representation of all categories

2. **Baseline metrics**
   - Run current system on validation set
   - Record precision, recall, F1, processing time

3. **A/B testing**
   - Test each recommendation independently
   - Measure impact on validation metrics
   - Check for unintended side effects

4. **Combined testing**
   - Test #1 + #2 combination
   - Tune parameters jointly
   - Verify no negative interactions

5. **Error analysis**
   - Examine new false positives introduced
   - Check if new false negatives appear
   - Iterate on threshold/boost values

---

## Conclusion

The current system (OPENAI-LARGE + ADAPTIVE) is performing well but has **one primary bottleneck**: the **GMM threshold is too conservative**, rejecting 150 pairs (37.6% of FNs) that score 80-100% confidence.

**Top Priority Actions:**
1. **Adjust GMM threshold** (P(same|score) from 0.98 to 0.90) - **Quick win, high impact**
2. **Add acronym detection** - **Addresses 36% of FNs**
3. Monitor precision to ensure it stays above 90%

**Expected Outcome:**
- F1 Score: 82.4% → **86-90%**
- Recall: 74% → **84-90%**
- Precision: 93% → **89-91%**

This would position the system as a **high-performance entity name resolution solution** suitable for production use.
